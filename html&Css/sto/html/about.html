<h1>About</h1>
<p>“I co-founded this company because of my passion for testing and do this through context driven testing.
    Testing is a challenging craft. I dare to be different and think outside the box.
    I am welcoming, creating and growing with the changes.
    I offer customer to have a free limit session of software testing service before you assign to a shorter assignment
    or part time assignment.”</p>
